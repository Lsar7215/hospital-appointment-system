1. Introduction
The Hospital Appointment Booking System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing patient appointments. It provides three types of users:
Patients – to book, view, and manage their appointments.
Doctors – to manage availability, view appointments, and record consultation notes.
Administrators – to oversee the hospital’s scheduling system, manage doctors, and generate reports.
This system reduces manual work, prevents double bookings, and improves the overall patient experience.

2. Objectives
Simplify the process of booking and managing appointments.
Provide real-time availability of doctors.
Reduce waiting times and scheduling conflicts.
Ensure secure storage of patient and doctor data.
Provide administrators with analytics and reports.

3. Scope
The system will cover:
Appointment booking and cancellation.
Doctor availability management.
Role-based access (patient, doctor, admin).
Automatic scheduling and conflict prevention.
Data storage with security and privacy compliance.
Reporting features for administrators.

4. Functional Requirements
Patient Functions
Register/login.
Search doctors by name, specialization, or availability.
Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
View appointment history.
Doctor Functions
Login and manage profile.
Set and update availability schedule.
View daily/weekly appointments.
Mark completed/missed appointments.
Add consultation notes.
Administrator Functions
Manage doctor profiles (add, edit, delete).
Monitor appointment system.
Generate reports (appointments, no-shows, doctor utilization).

5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Handle high number of concurrent users.
Security: Encrypt sensitive data, implement authentication & authorization.
Scalability: Support future growth (more doctors/patients).
Usability: Simple, intuitive interface for all users.
Availability: System uptime > 99% during working hours.
Maintainability: Modular code structure for easy updates.
