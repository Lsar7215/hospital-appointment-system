# 🏥 Hospital Appointment Booking System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Hospital Appointment Booking System is a web-based application that allows **patients** to book appointments with doctors, **doctors** to manage their schedules and patient records, and **administrators** to oversee the hospital’s appointment process.

The goal is to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform that improves hospital efficiency and patient experience.
